# Agri-nauts: Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making

Welcome to the Agri-nauts project repository for NASA Space Apps 2024! Our team has developed an innovative mobile application that combines artificial intelligence and satellite data to revolutionize agricultural decision-making.


## Project Overview

Farmers worldwide face numerous water-related challenges due to unpredictable weather patterns, including droughts, floods, and soil moisture issues. These problems significantly impact crop health, farmer profits, and global food security. Our solution, the Agri-nauts app, addresses these challenges by leveraging Earth observation data and AI to provide informed agricultural decision-making tools.

## Key Features

1. **Weather and Environmental Predictions**
   - Soil moisture forecasting
   - Drought stage predictions
   - Air quality forecasts
   - Flood prediction model

2. **Plant Disease Detection**
   - Uses computer vision with 92% accuracy
   - Identifies plant diseases through smartphone camera
   - Suggests appropriate treatments

3. **AI-Powered Chatbot**
   - Provides quick solutions to common agricultural problems

4. **Community Hub**
   - Allows users to share experiences and problems
   - Features a Scientific Lab section with latest research and agricultural solutions

5. **Integrated Marketplace**
   - Enables users to buy and sell agricultural products, including fertilizers, pesticides, and equipment

## Technology Stack

- **Mobile App Development**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend**: Not specified (Please add details)
- **ML/Data**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning algorithms (RNN-LSTM), Computer Vision
