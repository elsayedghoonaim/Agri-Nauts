# Agri-nauts: Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making

Welcome to the Agri-nauts project repository for NASA Space Apps 2024! Our team has developed an innovative mobile application that combines artificial intelligence and satellite data to revolutionize agricultural decision-making.


## Project Overview

Farmers worldwide face numerous water-related challenges due to unpredictable weather patterns, including droughts, floods, and soil moisture issues. These problems significantly impact crop health, farmer profits, and global food security. Our solution, the Agri-nauts app, addresses these challenges by leveraging Earth observation data and AI to provide informed agricultural decision-making tools.

## Key Features

1. **Weather and Environmental Predictions**
   - Soil moisture forecasting
   - Drought stage predictions
   - Air quality forecasts
   - Flood prediction model

2. **Plant Disease Detection**
   - Uses computer vision with 92% accuracy
   - Identifies plant diseases through smartphone camera
   - Suggests appropriate treatments

3. **AI-Powered Chatbot**
   - Provides quick solutions to common agricultural problems

4. **Community Hub**
   - Allows users to share experiences and problems
   - Features a Scientific Lab section with latest research and agricultural solutions

5. **Integrated Marketplace**
   - Enables users to buy and sell agricultural products, including fertilizers, pesticides, and equipment

## Technology Stack

- **Mobile App Development**: Flutter (Dart)
- **Backend**: Not specified (Please add details)
- **ML/Data**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning algorithms (RNN-LSTM), Computer Vision
  
## Data Source

## Prerequisites

To ensure that the code runs smoothly, the following Python libraries and packages should be installed. Below is a list of required libraries along with instructions on how to install them.

## Required Libraries

1. **time** - A built-in Python library for time-related functions.
2. **pickle** - A built-in Python library for serializing and deserializing Python objects.
3. **numpy** - A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
4. **pandas** - A library for data manipulation and analysis.
5. **matplotlib** - A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
6. **seaborn** - A Python data visualization library based on `matplotlib`.
7. **plotly.express** - A high-level interface to Plotly for creating figures.
8. **statsmodels** - A module that provides tools for estimating and testing statistical models.
   - `arima` - For ARIMA modeling.
   - `seasonal_decompose` - For time series decomposition.
   - `plot_acf`, `plot_pacf` - For autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots.
9. **sklearn (scikit-learn)** - A machine learning library for Python, especially for metrics like `mean_squared_error` and `mean_absolute_error`.
10. **cv2 (OpenCV)** - An open-source computer vision library.

### Installation

You can install these libraries using `pip`. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly statsmodels scikit-learn opencv-python
```
